\section{Meeting Recap}
\subsection{Progress this week}
We materialize our ideas and requirements into a visual user interface prototype in which we can review, make change, present to our customer to get feedbacks, and also a baseline for our later implementation.\par
We were also able to concrete the use case into more specific models: Class diagram and Sequence diagram. We discussed about these two diagram as they are critical for our later  implementation, but we also agreed that the current diagrams is not perfect and will definitely subject to change as we progress.\par
Lastly, we reviewed and warmed up our hand on the technologies stack we are going to use in this project, prepare the development environment as planned in last week so we can get going quickly once we start building the product.\par
Our customer was willing to meet with us, as they are part of the team


\subsection{Plans for the Upcoming Week}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start designing a database schemas prototype
	\item Start writing simple, essential SQL quesries based on our database schema prototype
	\item Start building simple prototype for our front-end and putting dummy data for placeholder so the front-end teams don't need to wait for back-end to finish
	\item Start implementing first version of our classes, which have been designed in the Class Diagram in this week
\end{itemize}
